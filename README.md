# Supply chain & data auditing

This repository contains an Ethereum DApp that demonstrates the supply chain between a seller and a buyer. The consumer process is similar compared to the traditional supply chain process. A seller can add items to the inventory system stored in the blockchain. A buyer can purchase such items from the inventory system. Additionally, a seller can mark an item as shipped, and similarly a buyer can mark an item as received.

The DApp user interface when running looks like this:
